	abstract = {The classical linear Spitzer-Harm formula has been shown to lead to an overestimation of the electron heat flux in laser-plasma interaction experiments. We briefly review the clas- sical theory of heat transport in a plasma, and give a simplified demonstration of the Spitzer-Harm formula. The electron heat conductivity is calculated for a large value of the ion charge Z. Correction due to a finite value of Z is evaluated with a simplified electron-electron collision operator. We then show that in a steep temperature gradient, the collisional mean free path of the electrons that transport the energy may be larger than the scale length of the temperature gradient. In this case the Spitzer-Harm formula over- estimates the actual heat flux in the main part of the temperature gradient, and predicts a too small heat flux slightly away from the location of the large temperature gradient. A nonlocal macroscopic formula, which is a sort of convolution of the Spitzer-Harm heat flux by a delocalization function, is shown to accurately describe the electron heat flow in both smooth and steep temperature gradients. This nonlocal formula for the heat flow is analytically justified. A selection of slightly different delocalization functions proposed in the literature is compared to the original one and to the results of Fokker-Planck calcula- tions of the heat flow. 1.},

	abstract = {The yield of an inertial confinement fusion capsule can be greatly affected by the inclusion of high-Z material in the fuel, either intentionally as a diagnostic or from mixing due to hydrodynamic instabilities. To validate calculations of these conditions, glass shell targets filled with a D2 and 3He fuel mixture were fielded in experiments with controlled amounts of pre-mixed Ar, Kr, or Xe. The experiments were fielded at the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] using 1.0 ns square laser pulses having a total energy 23 kJ and direct drive illumination of shells with an outer diameter of ∼925 $\mu$m and a thickness of ∼5 $\mu$m. Data were collected and compared to one-dimensional integrated models for yield and burn-temperature measurements. This paper presents a critical examination of the calculational assumptions used in our experimental modeling. A modified treatment of laser-capsule interaction improves the match to the measured scattered laser light and also improves agreement for yields, burn-temperatures, and the fuel compression as measured by the ratio of two yields. Remaining discrepancies between measurement and calculation will also be discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In the proposed 'shock ignition' route to fusion, the target is compressed at a relatively low temperature and then ignited using high intensity laser irradiation which drives a strong converging shock into the centre of the fuel. With a series of idealized calculations we analyse the electron transport of energy into the target, which produces the pressure responsible for driving the shock. We show that transport in shock ignition lies near the boundary between ablative and heat front regimes. Moreover, simulations indicate that non-local effects are significant in the heat front regime and might lead to increased efficiency by driving the shock more effectively and reducing heat losses to the plasma corona.},

@article{Reisner2013,
	abstract = {We introduce a new methodology for adding localized, space-time smooth, artificial viscosity to nonlinear systems of conservation laws which propagate shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities, which we call the C-method. We shall focus our attention on the compressible Euler equations in one space dimension. The novel feature of our approach involves the coupling of a linear scalar reaction-diffusion equation to our system of conservation laws, whose solution C(x, t) is the coefficient to an additional (and artificial) term added to the flux, which determines the location, localization, and strength of the artificial viscosity. Near shock discontinuities, C(x, t) is large and localized, and transitions smoothly in space-time to zero away from discontinuities. Our approach is a provably convergent, spacetime-regularized variant of the original idea of Richtmeyer and Von Neumann, and is provided at the level of the PDE, thus allowing a host of numerical discretization schemes to be employed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the C-method with three different numerical implementations and apply these to a collection of classical problems: the Sod shock-tube, the Osher-Shu shock-tube, the Woodward-Colella blast wave and the Leblanc shock-tube. First, we use a classical continuous finite-element implementation using second-order discretization in both space and time, FEM-C. Second, we use a simplified WENO scheme within our C-method framework, WENO-C. Third, we use WENO with the Lax-Friedrichs flux together with the C-equation, and call this WENO-LF-C. All three schemes yield higher-order discretization strategies, which provide sharp shock resolution with minimal overshoot and noise, and compare well with higher-order WENO schemes that employ approximate Riemann solvers, outperforming them for the difficult Leblanc shock tube experiment. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of laser imprint on target performance is critical to the success of directdrive inertial confinement fusion. Directly measuring the disruption caused by laser imprints to the imploding shell and hotspot formation, in comparison with multidimensional radiation–hydrodynamic simulations, can provide a clear picture of how laser nonuniformities cause target performance to degrade. With the recently developed xray selfemission imaging technique and the stateoftheart physics models recently implemented in the twodimensional hydrocode DRACO, a systematic study of laserimprint effects on warm target implosions on OMEGA has been performed using both experimental results and simulations. By varying the laserpicket intensity, the imploding shells were set at different adiabats (from $\alpha$ = 2 to $\alpha$ = 6). As the shell adiabats decreased, it was observed that (1) the measured shell thickness at the time the hot spot lit up became larger than the uniform onedimensional (1D) predictions; (2) the hotspot core emitted earlier than the corresponding 1D predictions; (3) the measured neutron yield first increased then decreased as the shell adiabat $\alpha$ was reduced; and (4) the hotspot size reduced as $\alpha$ decreased for cases where SSD (smoothing by spectral dispersion) was on but became larger for low$\alpha$ shots in cases where SSD was off. Most of these experimental observations are well reproduced by DRACO simulations with laser imprints including modes up to $\lambda$max = 200. These studies identify the importance of laser imprint as the major source of degrading target performance for OMEGA implosions of adiabat $\alpha$ ≤ 3. Mitigating laser imprints is required to improve low$\alpha$ target performance.},

This time includes a shock wave transit from the front to the rear surface of the target, and a rarefaction wave transit in the opposite direction. During this time interval, areal mass perturbations caused by all sources of nonuniformity (laser imprint, surface ripple) are expected to oscillate. The first direct experimental observations of the areal mass oscillations due to ablative Richtmyer–Meshkov (RM) instability and feedout followed by the RT growth of areal mass modulation are discussed. The experiments were made with 40–99 $\mu$m thick planar plastic targets rippled either on the front or on the rear with a sine wave ripple with either 30 or 45 $\mu$m wavelength and with 0.5, 1, or 1.5 $\mu$m amplitude.

	abstract = {Ultrahigh intensity lasers can potentially be used in conjunction with conventional fusion lasers to ignite inertial confinement fusion(ICF) capsules with a total energy of a few tens of kilojoules of laser light, and can possibly lead to high gain with as little as 100 kJ. A scheme is proposed with three phases. First, a capsule is imploded as in the conventional approach to inertial fusion to assemble a high‐density fuel configuration. Second, a hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablatedmaterial, as the critical density is pushed close to the high‐density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force associated with high‐intensity laser light. Finally, the fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the high‐intensity laser–plasma interactions, which then propagate from critical density to this high‐density core. This new scheme also drastically reduces the difficulty of the implosion, and thereby allows lower quality fabrication and less stringent beam quality and symmetry requirements from the implosion driver. The difficulty of the fusion scheme is transferred to the technological difficulty of producing the ultrahigh‐intensity laser and of transporting this energy to the fuel.},

	abstract = {In some regions of a laser driven inertial fusion target, the electron mean-free path can become comparable to or even longer than the electron temperature gradient scale-length. This can be particularly important in shock-ignited (SI) targets, where the laser-spike heated corona reaches temperatures of several keV. In this case, thermal conduction cannot be described by a simple local conductivity model and a Fick's law. Fluid codes usually employ flux-limited conduction models, which preserve causality, but lose important features of the thermal flow. A more accurate thermal flow modeling requires convolution-like non-local operators. In order to improve the simulation of SI targets, the non-local electron transport operator proposed by Schurtz-Nicolai-Busquet [G. P. Schurtz el al., Phys. Plasmas 7, 4238 (2000)1 has been implemented in the DUED fluid code. Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) simulations of SI targets have been performed. 1D simulations of the ablation phase highlight that while the shock profile and timing might be mocked up with a flux-limiter; the electron temperature profiles exhibit a relatively different behavior with no major effects on the final gain. The spike, instead, can only roughly be reproduced with a fixed flux-limiter value. 1D target gain is however unaffected, provided some minor tuning of laser pulses. 2D simulations show that the use of a non-local thermal conduction model does not affect the robustness to mispositioning of targets driven by quasi-uniform laser irradiation. 2D simulations performed with only two final polar intense spikes yield encouraging results and support further studies.

	abstract = {A comparison with flames sheds new light on the dynamics of ablation fronts in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). The mathematical formulation of the problem in ICF is the same as for flames propagating upwards. The difference concerns the Froude number F-r, yielding a different order of magnitude for the nondimensional wave number of the marginally stable disturbances. When the thermal conductivity varies strongly, as is the case in ICF, a wide range of characteristic (diffusive) lengths is involved across the wave structure. For disturbances with intermediate wavelengths, a "universal" diffusive relaxation rate of thermal waves is exhibited with no dependence on the heat conductivity. This is a key point for describing the dynamics of strongly accelerated ablation fronts whose marginally stable wavelength is much shorter than the total wave thickness. The coupling of hydrodynamics and heat conduction is analyzed in a way similar to flame theory, through the derivation of a kinematic relation for the ablation front including its thermal relaxation. A transition between the regimes of flames and ablation fronts in ICF is exhibited with decreasing F-r. For a moderate acceleration, F-r{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1, the result for flames is recovered. For a large acceleration, F-r of order unity, the thermal relaxation, when coupled with hydrodynamics, is shown to damp out the Darrieus-Landau instability, yielding the known result in ICF for strongly accelerated ablation fronts. For a wide class of models, including the simple two-length-scale model, the description is shown to be independent of the model. A weakly nonlinear analysis, valid irrespective of the number of unstable modes, is carried out for describing the early development of nonlinear structures of the ablation front in ICF. The role of the Darrieus-Landau instability at the early stage of irradiation is pointed out. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Lindl1995,
	abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion(ICF) is an approach to fusion that relies on the inertia of the fuel mass to provide confinement. To achieve conditions under which inertial confinement is sufficient for efficient thermonuclear burn, a capsule (generally a spherical shell) containing thermonuclear fuel is compressed in an implosion process to conditions of high density and temperature. ICF capsules rely on either electron conduction (direct drive) or x rays (indirect drive) for energy transport to drive an implosion. In direct drive, the laser beams (or charged particle beams) are aimed directly at a target. The laser energy is transferred to electrons by means of inverse bremsstrahlung or a variety of plasma collective processes. In indirect drive, the driver energy (from laser beams or ion beams) is first absorbed in a high‐Z enclosure (a hohlraum), which surrounds the capsule. The material heated by the driver emits x rays, which drive the capsule implosion. For optimally designed targets, 70{\%}–80{\%} of the driver energy can be converted to x rays. The optimal hohlraum geometry depends on the driver. Because of relaxed requirements on laser beam uniformity, and reduced sensitivity to hydrodynamic instabilities, the U.S. ICF Program has concentrated most of its effort since 1976 on the x‐ray or indirect‐drive approach to ICF. As a result of years of experiments and modeling, we are building an increasingly strong case for achieving ignition by indirect drive on the proposed National Ignition Facility (NIF). The ignition target requirements for hohlraum energetics, radiation symmetry, hydrodynamic instabilities and mix, laser plasma interaction, pulse shaping, and ignition requirements are all consistent with experiments. The NIF laser design, at 1.8 MJ and 500 TW, has the margin to cover uncertainties in the baseline ignition targets. In addition, data from the NIF will provide a solid database for ion‐beam‐driven hohlraums being considered for future energy applications. In this paper we analyze the requirements for indirect drive ICF and review the theoretical and experimental basis for these requirements. Although significant parts of the discussion apply to both direct and indirect drive, the principal focus is on indirect drive.},

	abstract = {The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of magnetic-field compression in laser-driven spherical targets is considered. Magnetic-field evolution is cast in terms of an effective fluid velocity, a convective term resulting from resistivity gradients, a resistive diffusion term, and a source term. Effective velocity is the sum of fluid velocity, drift velocity, and heat-flux velocity, given by electron heat flux divided by electron enthalpy density, which has two components: the perpendicular or Nernst velocity and the cross-field velocity. The Nernst velocity compresses the magnetic field as the heat front moves into gas. The cross-field velocity leads to dynamo generation of an azimuthal magnetic field. It is proposed that the heat-flux velocity should be flux limited using a “Nernst” flux limiter independent of the thermal flux limiter but should not exceed it. The addition of the MHD routines to the 1D, Lagrangian hydrocode LILAC and the Eulerian version of the 2D hydrocode DRACO is described, and the codes are used to model a magnetized spherical compression on the OMEGA laser. Thermal flux limiting at a shock front is found to cause unphysical electron temperature gradients that lead to large, unphysical magnetic fields caused by the resistivity gradient, so thermal flux limiting in the gas is removed. The Nernst term reduces the benefits of magnetization in inertial fusion. A Nernst flux limiter ≤0.12 is required in the gas in order to agree with measured neutron yield and increases in the neutron-averaged ion temperature caused by magnetization. This corresponds to preventing the Nernst velocity from exceeding the shock velocity, which prevents significant decoupling of the magnetic field and gas compression.},

Time-resolved scattered-light spectra near $\omega$/2 and 3$\omega$/2 as well as time-resolved hard-x-ray measurements indicate the presence of a strongly driven two-plasmon-decay (TPD) instability at high intensities that may influence the observed laser light absorption.

	abstract = {In the interaction of high-power laser beams with solid density plasma there are a number of mechanisms that generate strong magnetic fields. Such fields subsequently inhibit or redirect electron flows, but can themselves be advected by heat fluxes, resulting in complex interplay between thermal transport and magnetic fields. We show that for heating by multiple laser spots reconnection of magnetic field lines can occur, mediated by these heat fluxes, using a fully implicit 2D Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code. Under such conditions, the reconnection rate is dictated by heat flows rather than Alfv{\`{e}}nic flows. We find that this mechanism is only relevant in a high $\beta$ plasma. However, the Hall parameter $\omega$c$\tau$ei can be large so that thermal transport is strongly modified by these magnetic fields, which can impact longer time scale temperature homogeneity and ion dynamics in the system.},

The experiment used plastic-shell targets with imposed surface defects (glue spots, wires, and mount stalks), which enhance self-generated fields. The fields were measured during the 1-ns laser drive with an on-target intensity 1e15W/cm2. Proton radiographs show multiple ring-like structures produced by electric fields ?107V/cm and fine structures from surface defects, indicating self-generated fields up to ?3 MG. These electric and magnetic fields show good agreement with two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations when the latter include the rTe?rne source, Nernst convection, and anisotropic resistivity. The simulations predict that self-generated fields affect heat fluxes in the conduction zone and, through this, affect the growth of local perturbations.},

Massive cryogenic shells are first imploded by direct laser light with a low implosion velocity and on a low adiabat leading to fuel assemblies with large areal densities. The assembled fuel is ignited from a central hot spot heated by the collision of a spherically convergent ignitor shock and the return shock. The resulting fuel assembly features a hot-spot pressure greater than the surrounding dense fuel pressure. Such a nonisobaric assembly requires a lower energy threshold for ignition than the conventional isobaric one. The ignitor shock can be launched by a spike in the laser power or by particle beams. The thermonuclear gain can be significantly larger than in conventional isobaric ignition for equal driver energy.},

	abstract = {Three models for nonlocal electron thermal transport are here compared against Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) codes to assess their accuracy in situations relevant to both inertial fusion hohlraums and tokamak scrape-off layers. The models tested are (i) a moment-based approach using an eigenvector integral closure (EIC) originally developed by Ji, Held and Sovinec; (ii) the non-Fourier Landau-fluid (NFLF) model of Dimits, Joseph and Umansky; and (iii) Schurtz, Nicola$\backslash$"i and Busquet's multigroup diffusion model (SNB). We find that while the EIC and NFLF models accurately predict the damping rate of a small-amplitude temperature perturbation (within 10{\%} at moderate collisionalities), they overestimate the peak heat flow by as much as 35{\%} and do not predict preheat in the more relevant case where there is a large temperature difference. The SNB model, however, agrees better with VFP results for the latter problem if care is taken with the definition of the mean free path. Additionally, we present for the first time a comparison of the SNB model against a VFP code for a hohlraum-relevant problem with inhomogeneous ionisation and show that the model overestimates the heat flow in the helium gas-fill by a factor of {\~{}}2 despite predicting the peak heat flux to within 16{\%}.},

It is also possible to satisfy the correct microscopic boundary conditions. The method consists in altering the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation. The modified collision terms are constructed so that each collision conserves particle number, momentum, and energy; other characteristics such as persistence of velocities and angular dependence may be included. The present article illustrates the technique for a simple model involving the assumption of a collision time independent of velocity; this model is applied to the study of small amplitude oscillations of one-component ionized and neutral gases. The initial value problem for unbounded space is solved by performing a Fourier transformation on the space variables and a Laplace transformation on the time variable. For uncharged gases there results the correct adiabatic limiting law for sound-wave propagation at high pressures and, in addition, one obtains a theory of absorption and dispersion of sound for arbitrary pressures. For ionized gases the difference in the nature of the organization in the low-pressure plasma oscillations and in high-pressure sound-type oscillations is studied. Two important cases are distinguished. If the wavelengths of the oscillations are long compared to either the Debye length or the mean free path, a small change in frequency is obtained as the collision frequency varies from zero to infinity. The accompanying absorption is small; it reaches its maximum value when the collision frequency equals the plasma frequency. The second case refers to waves shorter than both the Debye length and the mean free path; these waves are characterized by a very heavy absorption.},

A laser with a pulse length of 0.3 ns, a peak intensity of up to 5 x 10(13) W cm(-2) and a wavelength of 1.3 mu m was focused to a 0.15 mm wide line on 3 mm long zinc and 1 mm long iron targets and the probe was passed along the length of the plasma formed. The results show plasma 'hairs', or filaments, appearing only below the critical density, 0.1 ns before the peak of the laser pulse. The plasma around the critical density was clearly imaged and remained uniform. Magneto-hydrodynamic modelling indicates that this is caused by a magnetic field that diffuses from the critical surface, where it is generated, leading to a magnetic pressure comparable to the plasma pressure below the critical density. A dispersion relation is derived for density perturbations perpendicular to a temperature gradient in the presence of an existing magnetic field, which shows that such perturbations always grow, with the growth rate being the greatest for small wavelength perturbations and at low densities. These results indicate that the hair-like structures should be a typical feature of laser ablated plasmas below the critical density following significant plasma expansion, in agreement with numerous experimental results. The implications for x-ray lasers and fast ignition inertial confinement fusion are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes theoretical and experimental investigations of induced spatial incoherence (lSI), a technique for achieving the smooth and controllable target beam profiles required for direct-drive laser fusion. In conventional lSI, a broadband laser beam (coherence time t{\_}c = 1/ delta v {\textless}{\textless} t{\_}pulse) is sliced into an array of mutually incoherent beamlets by echelon structures that impose successive time delay increments delta t{\textgreater} t{\_}c. A focusing lens then overlaps those beamlets onto the target, which is usually located at the far field. Here, we evaluate the ideal target beam profiles for practical lSI focusing configurations, and examine the perturbing effects of transient interference, laser aberration, and plasma filamentation. Analytic and numerical calculations show that non uniformities due to interference among the beamlets are smoothed by both thermal diffusion and temporal averaging. Under laser-plasma conditions of interest to inertial confinement fusion (lCF), average ablation pressure nonuniformities -1 {\%} should be readily attainable. We also investigate a partial lSI scheme, which allows widely spaced beamlets to remain mutually coherent; the resulting high spatial frequency interference structure can be effectively smoothed by thermal diffusion alone. A perturbation analysis shows that the average target profile {\textless}I(x){\textgreater} remains relatively insensitive to laser beam aberration when the scale length of that aberration is larger than the initial beamlet width. This aberration will tend to broaden and smooth {\textless}I(x){\textgreater}, rather than introduce any small-scale structure. The broadening is largely controllable because it depends only upon spatial averages of the aberrated quantities over the entire laser aperture; the uncontrollable perturbations can be reduced to {\~{}} 1 {\%} in practical cases. Filamentation in the underdense plasma has been studied numerically using a 2D propagation/hydro code SELFOCT, which includes both ponderomotive and thermal effects. For 0.25-um light, this code predicts that ISI should suppress filamentation in plasmas of interest to ICF. We review recent planar target experiments carried out at the Naval Research Laboratory using 1.054- and 0.527-um light, which show that the combination of ISI and shorter wavelength substantially reduces all evidence of plasma instabilities. Finally, we review a promising alternative technique for achieving ISI in KrF lasers without using echelons.},

When I {\textgreater} 10(15) W cm(-2), a time-dependent flux limiter is required. The match of corona temperatures computed by the fluid and FP code is also investigated as I increases. It is found that corona temperatures cannot agree well with each other at laser intensities above similar to 5 x 10(14) W cm(-2) due to the occurrence of a temperature jump near the critical surface in fluid simulation.},

Before being imploded, the targets were immersed in an 80-kG magnetic seed field. Upon laser irradiation, the high implosion velocities and ionization of the target fill trapped the magnetic field inside the capsule, and it was amplified to tens of megagauss through flux compression. At such strong magnetic fields, the hot spot inside the spherical target was strongly magnetized, reducing the heat losses through electron confinement. The experimentally observed ion temperature was enhanced by 15{\%}, and the neutron yield was increased by 30{\%}, compared to nonmagnetized implosions [P. Y. Chang et al., Phys. Rev.

The advantage of the ADE-CPML method is that it provides a more flexible representation that can be extended to higher-order methods.

The thermal smoothing effect is expected to take place in the preformed plasma when the direct-drive laser pulse comes onto the target, and then, the initial imprint can be significantly reduced. Planar target experiments on the indirect–direct-hybrid irradiation scheme were performed. The preformed plasma profile was measured by using x-ray side-on backlighting method. The reduction of the initial imprint was demonstrated by the indirect–direct-hybrid irradiation scheme on planar target experiments. The imprint is suppressed by a factor of 1.5–7 depending on x-ray preirradiation conditions.

This approach is consistent with the constraints on frequency tripling the light, and it will not produce any significant high‐intensity spikes within the laser chain, making the technique attractive for the high‐power glass lasers used in current fusion experiments. Smoothing is obtained by imposing a frequency‐modulated bandwidth on the laser beam using an electro‐optic crystal. A pair of gratings is used to disperse the frequencies across the beam, without distorting the temporal pulse shape. The beam is broken up into beamlets, using a phase plate, such that the beamlet diffraction‐limited focal spot is the size of the target. The time‐averaged interference between beamlets is greatly reduced because of the frequency differences between the beamlets, and the result is a relatively smooth diffraction‐limited intensity pattern on target.},

	abstract = {Experimental results and simulations that study the effects of thin metallic layers with high atomic number ?high-Z? on the hydrodynamics of laser accelerated plastic targets are presented. These experiments employ a laser pulse with a low-intensity foot that rises into a high-intensity main pulse. This pulse shape simulates the generic shape needed for high-gain fusion implosions. Imprint of laser nonuniformity during start up of the low intensity foot is a well-known seed for hydrodynamic instability. Large reductions are observed in hydrodynamic instability seeded by laser imprint when certain minimum thickness gold or palladium layers are applied to the laser-illuminated surface of the targets. The experiment indicates that the reduction in imprint is at least as large as that obtained by a 6 times improvement in the laser uniformity. Simulations supported by experiments are presented showing that during the low intensity foot the laser light can be nearly completely absorbed by the high-Z layer. X rays originating from the high-Z layer heat the underlying lower-Z plastic target material and cause large buffering plasma to form between the layer and the accelerated target. This long-scale plasma apparently isolates the target from laser nonuniformity and accounts for the observed large reduction in laser imprint. With onset of the higher intensity main pulse, the high-Z layer expands and the laser light is transmitted. This technique will be useful in reducing laser imprint in pellet implosions and thereby allow the design of more robust targets for high-gain laser fusion.},

A key step on the way to ignition is to have the energy generated through fusion reactions in an inertially confined fusion plasma exceed the amount of energy deposited into the deuterium-tritium fusion fuel and hotspot during the implosion process, resulting in a fuel gain greater than unity. Here we report the achievement of fusion fuel gains exceeding unity on the US National Ignition Facility using a 'high-foot' implosion method, which is a manipulation of the laser pulse shape in a way that reduces instability in the implosion. These experiments show an order-of-magnitude improvement in yield performance over past deuterium-tritium implosion experiments. We also see a significant contribution to the yield from $\alpha$-particle self-heating and evidence for the 'bootstrapping' required to accelerate the deuterium-tritium fusion burn to eventually 'run away' and ignite.},

	abstract = {HELIOS-CR is a user-oriented 1D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code to simulate the dynamic evolution of laser-produced plasmas and z-pinch plasmas. It includes an in-line collisional-radiative (CR) model for computing non-LTE atomic level populations at each time step of the hydrodynamics simulation. HELIOS-CR has been designed for ease of use, and is well-suited for experimentalists, as well as graduate and undergraduate student researchers. The energy equations employed include models for laser energy deposition, radiation from external sources, and high-current discharges. Radiative transport can be calculated using either a multi-frequency flux-limited diffusion model, or a multi-frequency, multi-angle short characteristics model. HELIOS-CR supports the use of SESAME equation of state (EOS) tables, PROPACEOS EOS/ multi-group opacity data tables, and non-LTE plasma properties computed using the inline CR modeling. Time-, space-, and frequency-dependent results from HELIOS-CR calculations are readily displayed with the HydroPLOT graphics tool. In addition, the results of HELIOS simulations can be post-processed using the SPECT3D Imaging and Spectral Analysis Suite to generate images and spectra that can be directly compared with experimental measurements. The HELIOS-CR package runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX platforms, and includes online documentation. We will discuss the major features of HELIOS-CR, and present example results from simulations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The primary goal of the experiments is twofold: to validate modeling related to implosion velocity and to estimate the magnitude of hot-electron preheat. Implosion experiments indicate that the energetics is well-modeled when cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) is included in the simulation and an overall multiplier to the CBET gain factor is employed; time-resolvedscattered light and scattered-lightspectra display the correct trends. Trajectories from backlit images are well modeled, although those from measured self-emission images indicate increased shell thickness and reduced shell density relative to simulations. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the most likely cause for the density reduction is nonuniformity growth seeded by laser imprint and not laser-energy coupling. Hot-electron preheat is at tolerable levels in the ongoing experiments, although it is expected to increase after the mitigation of CBET. Future work will include continued model validation, imprint measurements, and mitigation of CBET and hot-electron preheat.},

An underdense plasma, reminiscent of the gas fill of a hohlraum, is heated by a laser speckle with I lambda(2) = 1.0 x 10(15) W cm(-2) mu m(2) and radius omega(0) = 5 mu m. Inverse bremsstrahlung absorption of the laser and non-local electron transport lead to the development of a collisional analogue of the Weibel electromagnetic instability. The instability is seeded by magnetic fields, generated in an initial period of linear growth due to the anisotropic electron distribution arising in a laser speckle. Using the circular polarization does not generate significant fields. For linear polarization, the field generally saturates when the magnetization is omega tau(ei) {\textgreater} 1, and the effective growth rate is similar to the coherence time of typical laser speckles. The presence of these magnetic fluctuations significantly affects the heat fluxes and hydrodynamics in the plasma.},

	abstract = {A major advantage of the laser direct-drive (DD) approach to ignition is the increased fraction of laser drive energy coupled to the hot spot and relaxed hot-spot requirements for the peak pressure and convergence ratios relative to the indirect-drive approach at equivalent laser energy. With the goal of a successful ignition demonstration using DD, the recently established national strategy has several elements and involves multiple national and international institutions. These elements include the experimental demonstration on OMEGA cryogenic implosions of hot-spot conditions relevant for ignition at MJ-scale energies available at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and developing an understanding of laser-plasma interactions and laser coupling using DD experiments on the NIF. DD designs require reaching central stagnation pressures in excess of 100 Gbar. The current experiments on OMEGA have achieved inferred peak pressures of 56 Gbar (Regan et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 025001). Extensive analysis of the cryogenic target experiments and two-and three-dimensional simulations suggest that power balance, target offset, and target quality are the main limiting factors in target performance. In addition, cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) has been identified as the main mechanism reducing laser coupling. Reaching the goal of demonstrating hydrodynamic equivalence on OMEGA includes improving laser power balance, target position, and target quality at shot time. CBET must also be significantly reduced and several strategies have been identified to address this issue.},

We find that the reduced model reproduces the peak heat flux well in the ablation region but significantly over-predicts the coronal preheat. The suitability of the reduced model for computing non-local transport effects other than thermal conductivity is considered by comparing the computed distribution function to the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck distribution function. It is shown that even when the reduced model reproduces the correct heat flux, the distribution function is significantly different to the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck prediction.

	abstract = {The effect of the induced spatial incoherence (ISI) and the random phase screen (RPS) optical smoothing techniques on the filamentation instability in laser plasmas has been investigated numerically and analytically. A two‐dimensional time‐dependent laser–plasma propagation code, including both ponderomotive and thermal‐conduction dominated filamentation, is used to simulate the laser–plasma interaction. The results of these simulations are compared to the predictions of a simple theory that describes the filamentation of both coherent light and spatially and temporally incoherent light. It is shown that filaments driven by the thermal mechanism tend to cluster together and produce greater large scale nonuniformities in the laser illumination than the ponderomotively driven filaments. The RPS optical smoothing technique is found to reduce filamentation only if fast focusing optics (f/♯≲5) are used. The ISI smoothing method suppresses filamentation for fast or slow focusing optics, and requires only moderate laser bandwidth ($\Delta$$\omega$/$\omega$≂0.1{\%}). In general, the ISI smoothing method provides the best suppression of filamentation. Under common laboratory conditions, filamentation is pronounced at longer laser wavelengths (1.06 $\mu$m–0.53 $\mu$m), suggesting that current experiments may be dominated by filamentation effects. Optical smoothing methods can suppress, but not eradicate, filamentation effects at these wavelengths. The optical smoothing methods are most effective in short‐wavelength (0.25 $\mu$m) laser‐driven plasmas. At 0.25 $\mu$m laser wavelength, ISI is found to completely eliminate filamentation effects in both time‐averaged and instantaneous intensity distributions.},

We present the key features of laser deflagration, and consider the similarities and differences between the laser plasma flow and the slow combustion front. We discuss the linear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in laser ablation, short-wavelength stabilization of the instability due to the mass flow, and demonstrate the importance of the concepts and methods of combustion science for an understanding of the corresponding ICF processes. We show the possibility of the Darrieus-Landau instability in the laser ablation flow and discuss the specific features of the instability at the linear and nonlinear stages as compared to the combustion counterpart of this phenomenon. We consider the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the ICF and generation of ultra-high magnetic field by the instability, and show that proper understanding of vorticity production in the laser plasma and, hence, of the magnetic field generation requires concepts from combustion science.},

@article{Marocchino2014,
	abstract = {In some regions of a laser driven inertial fusion target, the electron mean-free path can become comparable to or even longer than the electron temperature gradient scale-length. This can be particularly important in shock-ignited (SI) targets, where the laser-spike heated corona reaches temperatures of several keV. In this case, thermal conduction cannot be described by a simple local conductivity model and a Fick's law. Fluid codes usually employ flux-limited conduction models, which preserve causality, but lose important features of the thermal flow. A more accurate thermal flow modeling requires convolution-like non-local operators. In order to improve the simulation of SI targets, the non-local electron transport operator proposed by Schurtz-Nicolai-Busquet [G. P. Schurtz el al., Phys. Plasmas 7, 4238 (2000)1 has been implemented in the DUED fluid code. Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) simulations of SI targets have been performed. 1D simulations of the ablation phase highlight that while the shock profile and timing might be mocked up with a flux-limiter; the electron temperature profiles exhibit a relatively different behavior with no major effects on the final gain. The spike, instead, can only roughly be reproduced with a fixed flux-limiter value. 1D target gain is however unaffected, provided some minor tuning of laser pulses. 2D simulations show that the use of a non-local thermal conduction model does not affect the robustness to mispositioning of targets driven by quasi-uniform laser irradiation. 2D simulations performed with only two final polar intense spikes yield encouraging results and support further studies.

Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] show that energy transfer between crossing laser beams can reduce laser absorption by 10{\%}-20{\%}. A new quantitative model for the crossed-beam energy transfer has been developed, allowing one to simulate the coupling of multiple beams in the expanding corona of implosion targets. Scattered-light and bang-time measurements show good agreement with predictions of this model when nonlocal heat transport is employed. The laser absorption can be increased by narrowing laser beams and/or employing two-color light, which both reduce the crossed-beam energy transfer. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {The velocity dependence of the collision frequency nu in a plasma causes the appearance of the thermoelectric field and heat flux effects in Ohm's law. An artificial dependence on electron velocity nu of v varies as nu -2 allows an exact representation of the two terms valid for any isotropic lowest order distribution function. The thermoelectric coefficient and the electric conductivity are isotropic (i.e. independent of the Hall parameter) in this model, and there is a magnetomotive force, additional to the usual v*B/c term, equal to 2(q T *B)/5(p e c) where q T is the total electron flux (measured in the ion rest frame) and p e is the electron pressure. Similarly the inertial contribution to Ohm's law depends on delta q T / delta t. Comparison is made with the full Braginskii transport (as modified by Epperlein and Haines 1986), including electron-electron collisions, for a lowest order Maxwellian distribution. If Ohm's law is written in a more physical form to include a term in q e *B (where q e is the electron heat flux measured in the electron fluid rest frame), it leads to a good approximation also to an isotropic thermoelectric coefficient and electric conductivity. Some applications of this new form of Ohm's law are outlined, particularly the role of the q e *B term.},

The full set of nonlocal transport coefficients is given and discussed. Nonlocality of transport enhances electron fluxes across magnetic field above the values given by strongly collisional local theory. Dispersion and damping of magnetohydrodynamic waves in weakly collisional plasmas is discussed.

Even for small hall parameters ({\$}\backslashomega \backslashtau{\_}{\{}ei{\}} \backslashlesssim 0.05{\$}) self-generated magnetic fields are sufficient to invert and enhance pressure perturbations. The mode inversion is caused by a combination of the Nernst advection of the magnetic field and the Righi-Leduc heat-flux. Non-local effects modify these processes. The mechanism is robust under plasma conditions tested; it is amplitude independent and occurs for a broad spectrum of perturbation wavelengths, {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}p = 10-100\backslash,\backslashmu{\$}m. The ablating plasma response to a dynamically evolving speckle pattern perturbation, analogous to an optically smoothed beam, is also simulated. Similar to the single mode case, self-generated magnetic fields increase the degree of nonuniformity at the ablation surface by up to an order of magnitude and are found to preferentially enhance lower modes due to the resistive damping of high mode number magnetic fields.},

This is based on assuming that the relationship between the Nernst velocity and the heat flow velocity is unaffected by nonlocality. The validity of this assumption is confirmed over a wide range of plasma conditions by comparing Vlasov-Fokker-Planck and flux-limited classical transport simulations. Additionally, we observe that the Righi-Leduc heat flow is more severely affected by nonlocality due to its dependence on high velocity moments of the electron distribution function, but are unable to suggest a reliable method of accounting for this in fluid simulations.},

	abstract = {Reaching ignition in direct-drive (DD) inertial confinement fusion implosions requires achieving central pressures in excess of 100 Gbar. The OMEGA laser system [T. R. Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] is used to study the physics of implosions that are hydrodynamically equivalent to the ignition designs on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [J. A. Paisner et al., Laser Focus World 30, 75 (1994)]. It is shown that the highest hot-spot pressures (up to 40 Gbar) are achieved in target designs with a fuel adiabat of $\alpha$ ≃ 4, an implosion velocity of 3.8 × 107 cm/s, and a laser intensity of ∼1015 W/cm2. These moderate-adiabat implosions are well understood using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations. The performance of lower-adiabat implosions is significantly degraded relative to code predictions, a common feature between DD implosions on OMEGA and indirect-drive cryogenic implosions on the NIF. Simplified theoretical models are developed to gain physical understanding of the implosion dynamics that dictate the target performance. These models indicate that degradations in the shell density and integrity (caused by hydrodynamic instabilities during the target acceleration) coupled with hydrodynamics at stagnation are the main failure mechanisms in low-adiabat designs. To demonstrate ignition hydrodynamic equivalence in cryogenic implosions on OMEGA, the target-design robustness to hydrodynamic instability growth must be improved by reducing laser-coupling losses caused by cross beam energy transfer.},

The results are used to calculate surface perturbations, growth factors, and laser imprint efficiencies. These in turn are used with standard RT growth formulas to predict perturbation growth in multimode simulations of compression and acceleration of planar and spherical targets.

	abstract = {A flexible direct-drive target platform is used to implode cryogenic deuterium-tritium (DT) capsules on the OMEGA laser [Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)]. The goal of these experiments is to demonstrate ignition hydrodynamically equivalent performance where the laser drive intensity, the implosion velocity, the fuel adiabat, and the in-flight aspect ratio (IFAR) are the same as those for a 1.5-MJ target [Goncharov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 165001 (2010)] designed to ignite on the National Ignition Facility [Hogan et al., Nucl. Fusion 41, 567 (2001)]. The results from a series of 29 cryogenic DT implosions are presented. The implosions were designed to span a broad region of design space to study target performance as a function of shell stability (adiabat) and implosion velocity. Ablation-front perturbation growth appears to limit target performance at high implosion velocities. Target outer-surface defects associated with contaminant gases in the DT fuel are identified as the dominant perturbation source at the ablation surface; performance degradation is confirmed by 2D hydrodynamic simulations that include these defects. A trend in the value of the Lawson criterion [Betti et al., Phys. Plasmas 17, 058102 (2010)] for each of the implosions in adiabat-IFAR space suggests the existence of a stability boundary that leads to ablator mixing into the hot spot for the most ignition-equivalent designs.

	abstract = {The authors study the different physical processes involved in laser-produced plasma in confined geometry. With this technique, a laser irradiates a target at an intensity of a few GW/cm2, and the produced plasma is confined by a transport overlay to the laser which covers this target. This configuration has appeared necessary for example for metallurgical applications where, for a given laser energy, enhanced pressures must be realized in order to achieve high shock pressures. Therefore, a physical study of this method is useful in order to optimize this technique. They have first developed an analytical model which describes the different steps involved in this process, points out the interest of this technique, and compares it to the direct ablation regime. In the first stage, during the laser heating, the generated pressure is typically 4-10 times greater than the corresponding one obtained in direct ablation. The second step begins after the switch-off of the laser and is characterized by an adiabatic cooling of the plasma which maintains the applied pressure over a period which is about two times the laser-pulse duration. Finally, the third stage concerns also the adiabatic cooling of the recombined plasma, but during this period the exerted pressure is too small to realize a plastic deformation of the material. They show that the impulse momentum given to the target is mainly generated during this step. This model allows them to also determine the velocities of thin foils accelerated with confined plasmas, and they show that very high hydrodynamic efficiencies can be achieved by this technique. Experimentally, they measured with quartz gauges, the pressures obtained in confined geometry, for 30-, 3-, and 0.6-ns laser-pulse duration. This study shows that short pulse durations are sensitive to the initial roughness of the interface, and such an effect should be suppressed by using a liquid confinement. Then, they conclude that a large fraction of the absorbed laser energy (80{\%}-90{\%}) is used for the ionization of the medium in these conditions of irradiation. Finally, they experimentally point out that the laser-induced breakdown of the confining medium is the main mechanism which limits the generated pressure and show the influence of the laser-pulse duration on this effect},

The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting.

	abstract = {The Biermann Battery effect is frequently invoked in cosmic magnetogenesis and studied in High-Energy Density laboratory physics experiments. Generation of magnetic fields by the Biermann effect due to mis-aligned density and temperature gradients in smooth flow behind shocks is well known. We show that a Biermann-effect magnetic field is also generated within shocks. Direct implementation of the Biermann effect in MHD codes does not capture this physical process, and worse, produces unphysical magnetic fields at shocks whose value does not converge with resolution. We show that this convergence breakdown is due to naive discretization, which fails to account for the fact that discretized irrotational vector fields have spurious solenoidal components that grow without bound near a discontinuity. We show that careful consideration of the kinetics of ion viscous shocks leads to a formulation of the Biermann effect that gives rise to a convergent algorithm. We note two novel physical effects: a resistive magnetic precursor in which Biermann-generated field in the shock "leaks" resistively upstream; and a thermal magnetic precursor, in which field is generated by the Biermann effect ahead of the shock front due to gradients created by the shock's electron thermal conduction precursor. Both effects appear to be potentially observable in experiments at laser facilities. We re-examine published studies of magnetogenesis in galaxy cluster formation, and conclude that the simulations in question had inadequate resolution to reliably estimate the field generation rate. Corrected estimates suggest primordial field values in the range {\$}B\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-22{\}}{\$}G --- {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-19{\}}{\$}G by {\$}z=3{\$}.},

@article{Craxton2015,
	abstract = {The direct-drive, laser-based approach to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is reviewed from its inception following the demonstration of the first laser to its implementation on the present generation of high-power lasers. The review focuses on the evolution of scientific understanding gained from target-physics experiments in many areas, identifying problems that were demonstrated and the solutions implemented. The review starts with the basic understanding of laser–plasma interactions that was obtained before the declassification of laser-induced compression in the early 1970s and continues with the compression experiments using infrared lasers in the late 1970s that produced thermonuclear neutrons. The problem of suprathermal electrons and the target preheat that they caused, associated with the infrared laser wavelength, led to lasers being built after 1980 to operate at shorter wavelengths, especially 0.35 $\mu$m—the third harmonic of the Nd:glass laser—and 0.248 $\mu$m (the KrF gas laser). The main physics areas relevant to direct drive are reviewed. The primary absorption mechanism at short wavelengths is classical inverse bremsstrahlung. Nonuniformities imprinted on the target by laser irradiation have been addressed by the development of a number of beam-smoothing techniques and imprint-mitigation strategies. The effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are mitigated by a combination of imprint reduction and target designs that minimize the instability growth rates. Several coronal plasma physics processes are reviewed. The two-plasmon–decay instability, stimulated Brillouin scattering (together with cross-beam energy transfer), and (possibly) stimulated Raman scattering are identified as potential concerns, placing constraints on the laser intensities used in target designs, while other processes (self-focusing and filamentation, the parametric decay instability, and magnetic fields), once considered important, are now of lesser concern for mainline direct-drive target concepts. Filamentation is largely suppressed by beam smoothing. Thermal transport modeling, important to the interpretation of experiments and to target design, has been found to be nonlocal in nature. Advances in shock timing and equation-of-state measurements relevant to direct-drive ICF are reported. Room-temperature implosions have provided an increased understanding of the importance of stability and uniformity. The evolution of cryogenic implosion capabilities, leading to an extensive series carried out on the 60-beam OMEGA laser [Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)], is reviewed together with major advances in cryogenic target formation. A polar-drive concept has been developed that will enable direct-drive–ignition experiments to be performed on the National Ignition Facility [Haynam et al., Appl. Opt. 46(16), 3276 (2007)]. The advantages offered by the alternative approaches of fast ignition and shock ignition and the issues associated with these concepts are described. The lessons learned from target-physics and implosion experiments are taken into account in ignition and high-gain target designs for laser wavelengths of 1/3 $\mu$m and 1/4 $\mu$m. Substantial advances in direct-drive inertial fusion reactor concepts are reviewed. Overall, the progress in scientific understanding over the past five decades has been enormous, to the point that inertial fusion energy using direct drive shows significant promise as a future environmentally attractive energy source.},

	abstract = {Indirectly driven inertial confinement fusion ?ICF? rests on the setting up of a radiation temperature within a laser cavity and on the optimization of the capsule implosion ablated by this radiation. In both circumstances, the ablation of an optically thick medium is at work. The nonlinear radiation conduction equations that describe this phenomenon admit different kinds of solutions called generically Marshak waves. In this paper, a completely analytic model is proposed to describe the ablation in the subsonic regime relevant to ICF experiments. This model approximates the flow by a deflagrationlike structure where Hugoniot relations are used in the stationary part from the ablation front up to the isothermal sonic Chapman–Jouguet point and where the unstationary expansion from the sonic point up to the external boundary is assumed quasi-isothermal. It uses power law matter properties. It can also accommodate arbitrary boundary conditions provided the ablation wave stays very subsonic and the surface temperature does not vary too quickly. These requirements are often met in realistic situations. Interestingly, the ablated mass rate, the ablation pressure, and the absorbed radiative energy depend on the time history of the surface temperature, not only on the instantaneous temperature values. The results compare very well with self-similar solutions and with numerical simulations obtained by hydrodynamic code. This analytic model gives insight into the physical processes involved in the ablation and is helpful for optimization and sensitivity studies in many situations of interest: radiation temperature within a laser cavity, acceleration of finite size medium, and ICF capsule implosion, for instance.},

	abstract = {Nonuniformities seeded by both long- and short-wavelength laser perturbations can grow via Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion, leading to performance reduction in low-adiabat implosions. To mitigate the effect of laser imprinting on target performance, spherical RT experiments have been performed on OMEGA using Si- or Ge-doped plastic targets in a cone-in-shell configuration. Compared to a pure plastic target, radiation preheating from these high-Z dopants (Si/Ge) increases the ablation velocity and the standoff distance between the ablation front and laser-deposition region, thereby reducing both the imprinting efficiency and the RT growth rate. Experiments showed a factor of 2-3 reduction in the laser-imprinting efficiency and a reduced RT growth rate, leading to significant (3-5 times) reduction in the $\sigma$(rms) of shell $\rho$R modulation for Si- or Ge-doped targets. These features are reproduced by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations using the two-dimensional hydrocode DRACO.},
